### Introduction

Talking Head (3D) is a JavaScript class featuring a 3D avatar that can
speak and lip-sync in real-time. The class supports
[Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/) full-body 3D avatars (GLB) and
[Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com) animations (FBX).
It also knows a set of emojis and can convert them into facial expressions.

You can create your own 3D avatar for free using the Ready Player Me service.
Alternatively, you can use a custom 3D avatar by making it compatible with
RPM models. See Appendix A for more details.

By default, the class uses
[Google Cloud TTS](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) for text-to-speech
and has a built-in lip-sync support for English, Finnish, and Lithuanian (beta).
New lip-sync languages can be added by creating new lip-sync language modules.

It is also possible to integrate the TalkingHead class with any external
TTS service that can provide word-level timestamps, such as the
[ElevenLabs WebSocket API](https://elevenlabs.io).
By using a TTS engine that outputs viseme IDs or
blend shape data, such as the
[Microsoft Azure Speech SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js),
you can extend TalkingHead's lip-sync support to 100+ languages.

The class uses [ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) / WebGL for 3D
rendering.

### Talking Head class

You can download the TalkingHead modules from
[releases](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/releases)
(without dependencies). Alternatively, you can import all the needed
modules from a CDN:

```javascript
<script type="importmap">
{ "imports":
  {
    "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.170.0/build/three.module.js/+esm",
    "three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.170.0/examples/jsm/",
    "talkinghead": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/met4citizen/TalkingHead@1.4/modules/talkinghead.mjs"
  }
}
</script>
```

If you want to use the built-in Google TTS and lip-sync using
Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality, give the class your TTS proxy endpoint and
a function from which to obtain the JSON Web Token needed to use that proxy.
Refer to Appendix B for one way to implement JWT SSO.

```javascript
import { TalkingHead } from "talkinghead";

// Create the talking head avatar
const nodeAvatar = document.getElementById('avatar');
const head = new TalkingHead( nodeAvatar, {
  ttsEndpoint: "/gtts/",
  jwtGet: jwtGet,
  lipsyncModules: ["en", "fi"]
});
```

> [!TIP]
> **FOR HOBBYISTS:** If you're just looking to experiment on your personal
laptop without dealing with proxies, JSON Web Tokens, or Single Sign-On,
take a look at the [minimal code example](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/examples/minimal.html).

try {
  await head.showAvatar( {
    url: './avatars/brunette.glb',
    body: 'F',
    avatarMood: 'neutral',
    ttsLang: "en-GB",
    ttsVoice: "en-GB-Standard-A",
    lipsyncLang: 'en'
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

An example of how to make the avatar speak the text on input `text` when
the button `speak` is clicked:

```javascript
// Speak 'text' when the button 'speak' is clicked
const nodeSpeak = document.getElementById('speak');
nodeSpeak.addEventListener('click', function () {
  try {
    const text = document.getElementById('text').value;
    if ( text ) {
      head.speakText( text );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});
```

The following table lists some of the key methods. See the source code for the rest:

Method | Description

`showAvatar(avatar, [onprogress=null])` | Load and show the specified avatar. The `avatar` object must include the `url` for GLB file. Optional properties are `body` for either male `M` or female `F` body form, `lipsyncLang`, `lipsyncHeadMovement`, `baseline` object for blend shape baseline, `modelDynamicBones` for dynamic bones (see Appendix E), `ttsLang`, `ttsVoice`, `ttsRate`, `ttsPitch`, `ttsVolume`, `avatarMood`, `avatarMute`, `avatarIdleEyeContact`, `avatarSpeakingEyeContact`, `avatarListeningEyeContact`, and `avatarIgnoreCamera`.
`setView(view, [opt])` | Set view. Supported views are `"full"`, `"mid"`, `"upper"`  and `"head"`. The `opt` object can be used to set `cameraDistance`, `cameraX`, `cameraY`, `cameraRotateX`, `cameraRotateY`.
`setLighting(opt)` | Change lighting settings. The `opt` object can be used to set `lightAmbientColor`, `lightAmbientIntensity`, `lightDirectColor`, `lightDirectIntensity`, `lightDirectPhi`, `lightDirectTheta`, `lightSpotColor`, `lightSpotIntensity`, `lightSpotPhi`, `lightSpotTheta`, `lightSpotDispersion`.
`speakText(text, [opt={}], [onsubtitles=null], [excludes=[]])` | Add the `text` string to the speech queue. The text can contain face emojis. Options `opt` can be used to set text-specific `lipsyncLang`, `ttsLang`, `ttsVoice`, `ttsRate`, `ttsPitch`, `ttsVolume`, `avatarMood`, `avatarMute`. Optional callback function `onsubtitles` is called whenever a new subtitle is to be written with the parameter of the added string. The optional `excludes` is an array of [start,end] indices to be excluded from audio but to be included in the subtitles.
`speakAudio(audio, [opt={}], [onsubtitles=null])` | Add a new `audio` object to the speech queue. In audio object, property `audio` is either `AudioBuffer` or an array of PCM 16bit LE audio chunks. Property `words` is an array of words, `wtimes` is an array of corresponding starting times in milliseconds, and `wdurations` an array of durations in milliseconds. If the Oculus viseme IDs are known, they can be given in optional `visemes`, `vtimes` and `vdurations` arrays. The object also supports optional timed callbacks using `markers` and `mtimes`. In addition, you can provide an optional `anim` as an animation template object that can drive your own blendshape or morph target data in sync with audio playback. See Appendix F for more details. The `opt` object can be used to set text-specific `lipsyncLang`.
`streamStart(opt={},  onAudioStart = null, onAudioEnd = null, onSubtitles = null)` | Sets the talking head in streaming mode. See Appendix G for streaming instructions.
`streamAudio(audio)` | Starts feeding audio chunks to talkinghead in the streaming mode. See Appendix G for streaming instructions.
`streamNotifyEnd()` | Signals the end of streaming audio chunks to the talkinghead. See Appendix G for streaming instructions.
`streamStop()` | Exits the streaming mode. See Appendix G for streaming instructions.
`speakEmoji(e)` | Add an emoji `e` to the speech queue.
`speakBreak(t)` | Add a break of `t` milliseconds to the speech queue.
`speakMarker(onmarker)` | Add a marker to the speech queue. The callback function `onmarker` is called when the queue processes the marker.
`lookAt(x,y,t)` | Make the avatar's head turn to look at the screen position (`x`,`y`) for `t` milliseconds.
`lookAhead(t)` | Make avatar look ahead for `t` milliseconds.
`lookAtCamera(t)` | Make the avatar's head turn to look at the camera for `t` milliseconds. If `avatarIgnoreCamera` is set to `true`, looks ahead for `t` milliseconds.

`stopBackgroundAudio()` | Stop playing the background audio.
`setMixerGain(speech, [background=null], [fadeSecs=0])` | The amount of gain for speech and background audio (see Web Audio API / GainNode for more information). Value `null` means no change. Optional `fadeSecs` parameter sets exponential fade in/out time in seconds.
`playAnimation(url, [onprogress=null], [dur=10], [ndx=0], [scale=0.01])` | Play Mixamo animation file for `dur` seconds, but full rounds and at least once. If the FBX file includes several animations, the parameter `ndx` specifies the index. Since Mixamo rigs have a scale 100 and RPM a scale 1, the `scale` factor can be used to scale the positions.
`stopAnimation()` | Stop the current animation started by `playAnimation`.
`playPose(url, [onprogress=null], [dur=5], [ndx=0], [scale=0.01])` | Play the initial pose of a Mixamo animation file for `dur` seconds. If the FBX file includes several animations, the parameter `ndx` specifies the index. Since Mixamo rigs have a scale 100 and RPM a scale 1, the `scale` factor can be used to scale the positions.
`stopPose()` | Stop the current pose started by `playPose`.
`playGesture(name, [dur=3], [mirror=false], [ms=1000])` | Play a named hand gesture and/or animated emoji for `dur` seconds with the `ms` transition time. The available hand gestures are `handup`, `index`, `ok`, `thumbup`, `thumbdown`, `side`, `shrug`. By default, hand gestures are done with the left hand. If you want the right handed version, set `mirror` to true. You can also use `playGesture` to play emojis. See Appendix D for more details. [&#8805;`v1.2`]
`stopGesture([ms=1000])` | Stop the gesture with `ms` transition time. [&#8805;`v1.2`]

### The `index.html` Test App

**NOTE:** *The `index.html` app was created for testing and developing
the TalkingHead class. It includes various integrations with several paid
services. If you only want to use the TalkingHead class in your own app,
there is no need to install and configure the `index.html` app.*

In addition to testing and development, the test app be used as an example of
how to integrate the TalkingHead class with [ElevenLabs WebSocket API](https://elevenlabs.io),
[Microsoft Azure Speech SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js),
[OpenAI](https://openai.com),
[Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api) and
[Grok](https://docs.x.ai).

You can try out the test app online [here on GitHub](https://met4citizen.github.io/TalkingHead/).
By default, the text-to-speech and AI features will not work, but you
can activate them by navigating to the settings menu (‚ò∞) and pasting
your own API key in the relevant field(s). Your API keys will not be stored,
so you will need to re-enter them each time you reload the page.

To set up the test app in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Copy the latest files to your own web server, for example:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead.git && rm -r TalkingHead/.git
```

2. Create the needed API proxies as described in Appendix B and check/update your proxy configuration in `index.html`:

```javascript
// API proxys
const jwtEndpoint = "/app/jwt/get"; // Get JSON Web Token for Single Sign-On
const openaiChatCompletionsProxy = "/openai/v1/chat/completions";
const openaiModerationsProxy = "/openai/v1/moderations";
const openaiAudioTranscriptionsProxy = "/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions";
const vertexaiChatCompletionsProxy = "/vertexai/";
const googleTTSProxy = "/gtts/";
const elevenTTSProxy = [
  "wss://" + window.location.host + "/elevenlabs/",
  "/v1/text-to-speech/",
  "/stream-input?model_id=eleven_multilingual_v2&output_format=pcm_22050"
];
const microsoftTTSProxy = [
  "wss://" + window.location.host + "/mstts/",
  "/cognitiveservices/websocket/v1"
];
const grokChatCompletionsProxy = "/grok/v1/chat/completions"; // Grok-beta
const llamaChatCompletionsProxy = "/llama/v1/chat/completions"; // Local llama.cpp
const localWhisperCppProxy = "/whisper/"; // Local whisper.cpp
```

3. The test app's UI supports Finnish and English. If you want to add another language, you need to add an another entry to the `i18n` object.

4. Add you own background images, videos, audio files, avatars etc. in the directory structure and update your site configuration `siteconfig.js` accordingly. The keys are in English, but the entries can include translations to other languages.

### FAQ

**Why not use the free Web Speech API?**

The free Web Speech API can't provide word-to-audio timestamps, which are
essential for accurate lip-sync. As far as I know, there is no way even to
get Web Speech API speech synthesis as an audio file or determine its
duration in advance. At some point I tried to use the Web Speech API
events for syncronization, but the results were not good.

**What paid text-to-speech service should I use?**

It depends on your use case and budget. If the built-in lip-sync support
is sufficient for your needs, I would recommend Google TTS, because
it gives you up to 4 million characters for free each month. If your
app needs to support multiple languages, I would consider Microsoft
Speech SDK.

**I would like to have lip-sync support for language X.**

You have two options. First, you can implement a word-to-viseme
class similar to those that currently exist for English and Finnish.
See Appendix C for detailed instructions.
Alternatively, you can check if Microsoft Azure TTS can provide visemes
for your language and use Microsoft Speech SDK integration (`speakAudio`)
instead of Google TTS and the built-in lip-sync (`speakText`).

**Can I use a custom 3D model?**

The class supports full-body Ready Player Me avatars. You can also make your
own custom model, but it needs to have a RPM compatible rig/bone structure
and all their blend shapes. Please refer to Appendix A and readyplayer.me
documentation for more details.

**Any future plans for the project?**

This is just a small side-project for me, so I don't have any big
plans for it. That said, there are several companies that are currently
developing text-to-3D-avatar and text-to-3D-animation features. If and
when they get released as APIs, I will probably take a look at them and see
if they can be used/integrated in some way to the project.

You can create and use your own 3D full-body model, but it has to be
Ready Player Me compatible. Their rig has a Mixamo-compatible bone
structure described here:

https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me/api-reference/avatars/full-body-avatars

For lip-sync and facial expressions, you also need to have ARKit and Oculus
compatible blend shapes, and a few additional ones, all listed in the
following two pages:

https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me/api-reference/avatars/morph-targets/apple-arkit
https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me/api-reference/avatars/morph-targets/oculus-ovr-libsync

The TalkingHead class supports both separated mesh and texture atlasing.

Here are some Blender Python scripts that could be useful in converting
custom models:

Script | Description
--- | ---
[rename-mixamo-bones.py](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/blender/rename-mixamo-bones.py) |¬†If your model doesn't have a compatible rig, you can auto-rig your model easily at [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com) and use this Blender script to rename the Mixamo bones.
[rename-rocketbox-shapekeys.py](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/blender/rename-rocketbox-shapekeys.py) |¬†Rename [Microsoft Rocketbox](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Rocketbox) model shape keys.
[rename-avatarsdk-shapekeys.py](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/blender/rename-avatarsdk-shapekeys.py) |¬†Rename [Avatar SDK MetaPerson](https://github.com/avatarsdk) model shape keys.
[build-extras-from-arkit.py](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/blender/build-extras-from-arkit.py) |¬†Build RPM extras (mouthOpen, mouthSmile, eyesClosed, eyesLookUp, eyesLookDown) from ARKit blendshapes.
[build-visemes-from-arkit.py](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/blender/build-visemes-from-arkit.py) |¬†Build Oculus visemes from ARKit blendshapes. As models are all different, you should fine-tune the script for best result. EXPERIMENTAL

### Appendix B: Create API Proxies with JSON Web Token (JWT) Single Sign-On (SSO)

1. Make a CGI script that generates a new JSON Web Token with an expiration time (exp). See [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) for more information about JWT and libraries that best fit your needs and architecture. In my own test setup, I return the generated JWT as JSON.

```json
{ "jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c" }
```

2. Protect your CGI script with some authentication scheme. Below is an example Apache 2.4 directory config that uses Basic authentication (remember to always use HTTPS/SSL!). Put your CGI script `get` in the `jwt` directory.

```apacheconf
# Restricted applications
<Directory "/var/www/app">
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted apps"
  AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
</Directory>

# JSON Web Token
<Directory "/var/www/app/jwt" >
  Options ExecCGI
  SetEnv REMOTE_USER %{REMOTE_USER}
  SetHandler cgi-script
</Directory>
```

3. Make an [External Rewriting Program](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/rewritemap.html#prg) script that verifies JSON Web Tokens. The script should return `OK` if the given token is not expired and its signature is valid. Start the script in Apache 2.4 config. User's don't use the verifier script directly, so put it in some internal directory, not under document root.

```apacheconf
# JSON Web Token verifier
RewriteEngine On
RewriteMap jwtverify "prg:/etc/httpd/jwtverify" apache:apache
```

4. Make a proxy configuration for each service you want to use. Add the required API keys and protect the proxies with the JWT token verifier. Below are some example configs for Apache 2.4 web server. Note that when opening a WebSocket connection (ElevenLabs, Azure) you can't add authentication headers in browser JavaScript. This problem is solved here by including the JWT token as a part of the request URL. The downside is that the token might end up in server log files. This is typically not a problem as long as you are controlling the proxy server, you are using HTTPS/SSL, and the token has an expiration time.


```apacheconf
# OpenAI API
<Location /openai/>
  RewriteCond ${jwtverify:%{http:Authorization}} !=OK
  RewriteRule .+ - [F]
  ProxyPass https://api.openai.com/
  ProxyPassReverse  https://api.openai.com/
  ProxyPassReverseCookiePath "/"  "/openai/"
  ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain ".api.openai.com" ".<insert-your-proxy-domain-here>"
  RequestHeader set Authorization "Bearer <insert-your-openai-api-key-here>"
</Location>

# Google TTS API
<Location /gtts/>
  RewriteCond ${jwtverify:%{http:Authorization}} !=OK
  RewriteRule .+ - [F]
  ProxyPass https://eu-texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1beta1/text:synthesize?key=<insert-your-api-key-here> nocanon
  RequestHeader unset Authorization
</Location>

# Microsoft Azure TTS WebSocket API (Speech SDK)
<LocationMatch /mstts/(?<jwt>[^/]+)/>
  RewriteCond ${jwtverify:%{env:MATCH_JWT}} !=OK
  RewriteRule .+ - [F]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} Upgrade [NC]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
  RewriteRule /mstts/[^/]+/(.+) "wss://<insert-your-region-here>.tts.speech.microsoft.com/$1" [P]
  RequestHeader set "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" <insert-your-subscription-key-here>
</LocationMatch>

# ElevenLabs Text-to-speech WebSocket API
<LocationMatch /elevenlabs/(?<jwt>[^/]+)/>
  RewriteCond ${jwtverify:%{env:MATCH_JWT}} !=OK
  RewriteRule .+ - [F]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} Upgrade [NC]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
  RewriteRule /elevenlabs/[^/]+/(.+) "wss://api.elevenlabs.io/$1" [P]
  RequestHeader set "xi-api-key" "<add-your-elevenlabs-api-key-here>"
</LocationMatch>
```

### Appendix C: Create A New Lip-sync Module

The steps that are common to all new languages:

- Create a new file named `lipsync-xx.mjs` where `xx` is your language code, and place the file in the `./modules/` directory. The language module should have a class named `LipsyncXx` where Xx is the language code. The naming in important, because the modules are loaded dynamically based on their names.
- The class should have (at least) the following two methods: `preProcessText` and `wordsToVisemes`. These are the methods used in the TalkingHead class.
- The purpose of the `preProcessText` method is to preprocess the given text by converting symbols to words, numbers to words, and filtering out characters that should be left unspoken (if any), etc. This is often needed to prevent ambiguities between TTS and lip-sync engines. This method takes a string as a parameter and returns the preprocessed string.
- The purpose of the `wordsToVisemes` method is to convert the given text into visemes and timestamps. The method takes a string as a parameter and returns a lip-sync object. The lipsync object has three required properties: `visemes`, `times`and `durations`.
  - Property `visemes` is an array of Oculus OVR viseme codes. Each viseme is one of the strings: `'aa'`, `'E'`, `'I'`, `'O'`, `'U'`, `'PP'`, `'SS'`, `'TH'`, `'CH'`, `'FF'`, `'kk'`, `'nn'`, `'RR'`, `'DD'`, `'sil'`. See the reference images here: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/audio-ovrlipsync-viseme-reference/
  - Property `times` is an array of starting times, one entry for each viseme in `visemes`. Starting times are to be given in relative units. They will be scaled later on based on the word timestamps that we get from the TTS engine.
  - Property `durations` is an array of relative durations, one entry for each viseme in `visemes`. Durations are to be given in relative units. They will be scaled later on based on the word timestamps that we get from the TTS engine.

The difficult part is to actually make the conversion from words to visemes.
What is the best approach depends on the language. Here are some typical
approaches to consider (not a comprehensive list):

- **Direct mapping from graphemes to phonemes to visemes**. This works well for languages that have a consistent one-to-one mapping between individual letters and phonemes. This was used as the approach for the Finnish language (`lipsync-fi.mjs`) giving >99.9% lip-sync accuracy compared to the Finnish phoneme dictionary. Implementation size was ~4k. Unfortunately not all languages are phonetically orthographic languages.
- **Rule-based mapping**. This was used as the approach for the English language (`lipsync-en.mjs`) giving around 80% lip-sync accuracy compared to the English phoneme dictionary. However, since the rules cover the most common words, the effective accuracy is higher. Implementation size ~12k.
- **Dictionary based approach**. If neither of the previous approaches work for your language, make a search from some open source phoneme dictionary. Note that you still need some backup algorithm for those words that are not in the dictionary. The problem with phoneme dictionaries is their size. For example, the CMU phoneme dictionary for English is ~5M.
- **Neural-net approach based on transformer models**. Typically this should be done on server-side as the model size can be >50M.

TalkingHead is supposed to be a real-time class, so latency is
always something to consider. It is often better to be small and fast than
to aim for 100% accuracy.

### Appendix D: Adding Custom Poses, Moods, Gestures, and Emojis (ADVANCED)

In the TalkingHead class, the avatar's movements are based on four
data structures: `head.poseTemplates`, `head.animMoods`,
`head.gestureTemplates`, and `head.animEmojis`. By using these
objects, you can give your avatar its own personal body language.

In `head.poseTemplates` the hip position is defined as an {x, y, z} coordinate
in meters, and bone rotations as Euler XYZ rotations in radians.
In each pose, the avatar should have its weight on the left leg, if any, as
the class automatically mirrors it for the right side. Setting the boolean
properties `standing`, `sitting`, `bend`, `kneeling`, and `lying` helps the class
make the transitions between different poses in proper steps.

```javascript
head.poseTemplates["custom-pose-1"] = {
  standing: true, sitting: false, bend: false, kneeling: false, lying: false,
  props: {
    'Hips.position':{x:0, y:0.989, z:0.001}, 'Hips.rotation':{x:0.047, y:0.007, z:-0.007}, 'Spine.rotation':{x:-0.143, y:-0.007, z:0.005}, 'Spine1.rotation':{x:-0.043, y:-0.014, z:0.012}, 'Spine2.rotation':{x:0.072, y:-0.013, z:0.013}, 'Neck.rotation':{x:0.048, y:-0.003, z:0.012}, 'Head.rotation':{x:0.05, y:-0.02, z:-0.017}, 'LeftShoulder.rotation':{x:1.62, y:-0.166, z:-1.605}, 'LeftArm.rotation':{x:1.275, y:0.544, z:-0.092}, 'LeftForeArm.rotation':{x:0, y:0, z:0.302}, 'LeftHand.rotation':{x:-0.225, y:-0.154, z:0.11}, 'LeftHandThumb1.rotation':{x:0.435, y:-0.044, z:0.457}, 'LeftHandThumb2.rotation':{x:-0.028, y:0.002, z:-0.246}, 'LeftHandThumb3.rotation':{x:-0.236, y:-0.025, z:0.113}, 'LeftHandIndex1.rotation':{x:0.218, y:0.008, z:-0.081}, 'LeftHandIndex2.rotation':{x:0.165, y:-0.001, z:-0.017}, 'LeftHandIndex3.rotation':{x:0.165, y:-0.001, z:-0.017}, 'LeftHandMiddle1.rotation':{x:0.235, y:-0.011, z:-0.065}, 'LeftHandMiddle2.rotation':{x:0.182, y:-0.002, z:-0.019}, 'LeftHandMiddle3.rotation':{x:0.182, y:-0.002, z:-0.019}, 'LeftHandRing1.rotation':{x:0.316, y:-0.017, z:0.008}, 'LeftHandRing2.rotation':{x:0.253, y:-0.003, z:-0.026}, 'LeftHandRing3.rotation':{x:0.255, y:-0.003, z:-0.026}, 'LeftHandPinky1.rotation':{x:0.336, y:-0.062, z:0.088}, 'LeftHandPinky2.rotation':{x:0.276, y:-0.004, z:-0.028}, 'LeftHandPinky3.rotation':{x:0.276, y:-0.004, z:-0.028}, 'RightShoulder.rotation':{x:1.615, y:0.064, z:1.53}, 'RightArm.rotation':{x:1.313, y:-0.424, z:0.131}, 'RightForeArm.rotation':{x:0, y:0, z:-0.317}, 'RightHand.rotation':{x:-0.158, y:-0.639, z:-0.196}, 'RightHandThumb1.rotation':{x:0.44, y:0.048, z:-0.549}, 'RightHandThumb2.rotation':{x:-0.056, y:-0.008, z:0.274}, 'RightHandThumb3.rotation':{x:-0.258, y:0.031, z:-0.095}, 'RightHandIndex1.rotation':{x:0.169, y:-0.011, z:0.105}, 'RightHandIndex2.rotation':{x:0.134, y:0.001, z:0.011}, 'RightHandIndex3.rotation':{x:0.134, y:0.001, z:0.011}, 'RightHandMiddle1.rotation':{x:0.288, y:0.014, z:0.092}, 'RightHandMiddle2.rotation':{x:0.248, y:0.003, z:0.02}, 'RightHandMiddle3.rotation':{x:0.249, y:0.003, z:0.02}, 'RightHandRing1.rotation':{x:0.369, y:0.019, z:0.006}, 'RightHandRing2.rotation':{x:0.321, y:0.004, z:0.026}, 'RightHandRing3.rotation':{x:0.323, y:0.004, z:0.026}, 'RightHandPinky1.rotation':{x:0.468, y:0.085, z:-0.03}, 'RightHandPinky2.rotation':{x:0.427, y:0.007, z:0.034}, 'RightHandPinky3.rotation':{x:0.142, y:0.001, z:0.012}, 'LeftUpLeg.rotation':{x:-0.077, y:-0.058, z:3.126}, 'LeftLeg.rotation':{x:-0.252, y:0.001, z:-0.018}, 'LeftFoot.rotation':{x:1.315, y:-0.064, z:0.315}, 'LeftToeBase.rotation':{x:0.577, y:-0.07, z:-0.009}, 'RightUpLeg.rotation':{x:-0.083, y:-0.032, z:3.124}, 'RightLeg.rotation':{x:-0.272, y:-0.003, z:0.021}, 'RightFoot.rotation':{x:1.342, y:0.076, z:-0.222}, 'RightToeBase.rotation':{x:0.44, y:0.069, z:0.016}
  }
};
head.playPose("custom-pose-1");
```

In `head.animMoods` the syntax is more complex, so I suggest that you take
a look at the existing moods. In `anims`, each leaf object is an animation
loop template. Whenever a loop starts, the class iterates through
the nested hierarchy of objects by following keys that match the current
state (`idle`, `talking`), body form (`M`, `F`), current view
(`full`, `upper`, `mid`, `head`), and/or probabilities (`alt` + `p`).
The next animation will be created internally by using the `animFactory`
method. The property `delay` (ms) determines how long that pose is held,
`dt` defines durations (ms) for each part in the sequence, and
`vs` defines the shapekeys and their target values for each part.

```javascript

head.animMoods["custom-mood-1"] = {
  baseline: { eyesLookDown: 0.1 },
  speech: { deltaRate: 0, deltaPitch: 0, deltaVolume: 0 },
  anims: [
    { name: 'breathing', delay: 1500, dt: [ 1200,500,1000 ], vs: { chestInhale: [0.5,0.5,0] } },
    { name: 'pose', alt: [
      { p: 0.2, delay: [5000,20000], vs: { pose: ['side'] } },
      { p: 0.2, delay: [5000,20000], vs: { pose: ['hip'] },
        'M': { delay: [5000,20000], vs: { pose: ['wide'] } }
      },
      { delay: [5000,20000], vs: { pose: ['custom-pose-1'] } }
    ]},
    { name: 'head',
      idle: { delay: [0,1000], dt: [ [200,5000] ], vs: { headRotateX: [[-0.04,0.10]], headRotateY: [[-0.3,0.3]], headRotateZ: [[-0.08,0.08]] } },
      talking: { dt: [ [0,1000,0] ], vs: { headRotateX: [[-0.05,0.15,1,2]], headRotateY: [[-0.1,0.1]], headRotateZ: [[-0.1,0.1]] } }
    },
    { name: 'eyes', delay: [200,5000], dt: [ [100,500],[100,5000,2] ], vs: { eyesRotateY: [[-0.6,0.6]], eyesRotateX: [[-0.2,0.6]] } },
    { name: 'blink', delay: [1000,8000,1,2], dt: [50,[100,300],100], vs: { eyeBlinkLeft: [1,1,0], eyeBlinkRight: [1,1,0] } },
    { name: 'mouth', delay: [1000,5000], dt: [ [100,500],[100,5000,2] ], vs : { mouthRollLower: [[0,0.3,2]], mouthRollUpper: [[0,0.3,2]], mouthStretchLeft: [[0,0.3]], mouthStretchRight: [[0,0.3]], mouthPucker: [[0,0.3]] } },
    { name: 'misc', delay: [100,5000], dt: [ [100,500],[100,5000,2] ], vs : { eyeSquintLeft: [[0,0.3,3]], eyeSquintRight: [[0,0.3,3]], browInnerUp: [[0,0.3]], browOuterUpLeft: [[0,0.3]], browOuterUpRight: [[0,0.3]] } }
  ]
};
head.setMood("custom-mood-1");

```

Typical value range is [0,1] or [-1,1]. At the end of each animation,
the value will automatically return to its baseline value.
If the value is an array, it defines a range for a uniform/Gaussian
random value (approximated using CLT). See the class method
`gaussianRandom` for more information.

In `head.gestureTemplates` each property is a subset of bone rotations
that will be used to override the current pose.

```javascript
head.gestureTemplates["salute"] = {
  'LeftShoulder.rotation':{x:1.706, y:-0.171, z:-1.756}, 'LeftArm.rotation':{x:0.883, y:-0.288, z:0.886}, 'LeftForeArm.rotation':{x:0, y:0, z:2.183}, 'LeftHand.rotation':{x:0.029, y:-0.298, z:0.346}, 'LeftHandThumb1.rotation':{x:1.43, y:-0.887, z:0.956}, 'LeftHandThumb2.rotation':{x:-0.406, y:0.243, z:0.094}, 'LeftHandThumb3.rotation':{x:-0.024, y:0.008, z:-0.012}, 'LeftHandIndex1.rotation':{x:0.247, y:-0.011, z:-0.084}, 'LeftHandIndex2.rotation':{x:0.006, y:0, z:0}, 'LeftHandIndex3.rotation':{x:-0.047, y:0, z:0.004}, 'LeftHandMiddle1.rotation':{x:0.114, y:-0.004, z:-0.055}, 'LeftHandMiddle2.rotation':{x:0.09, y:0, z:-0.007}, 'LeftHandMiddle3.rotation':{x:0.078, y:0, z:-0.006}, 'LeftHandRing1.rotation':{x:0.205, y:-0.009, z:0.023}, 'LeftHandRing2.rotation':{x:0.109, y:0, z:-0.009}, 'LeftHandRing3.rotation':{x:-0.015, y:0, z:0.001}, 'LeftHandPinky1.rotation':{x:0.267, y:-0.012, z:0.031}, 'LeftHandPinky2.rotation':{x:0.063, y:0, z:-0.005}, 'LeftHandPinky3.rotation':{x:0.178, y:-0.001, z:-0.014}
};
head.playGesture("salute",3);
```

In `head.animEmojis` each object is an animated emoji. Note that you can
also use `head.playGesture` to play animated emojis. This makes it easy to
combine a hand gesture and a facial expression by giving the gesture and
the emoji the same name.

```javascript
head.animEmojis["ü´§"] = { dt: [300,2000], vs: {
    browInnerUp: [0.5], eyeWideLeft: [0.5], eyeWideRight: [0.5], mouthLeft: [0.5], mouthPressLeft: [0.8], mouthPressRight: [0.2], mouthRollLower: [0.5], mouthStretchLeft: [0.7],   mouthStretchRight: [0.7]
  }
};
head.playGesture("ü´§",3);
```

### Appendix E: Dynamic Bones (ADVANCED)

If you want your character's hair or other body parts to wiggle as
the character moves, you can use TalkingHead's Dynamic Bones feature.
The built-in physics engine simulates Newton's equations
of motions using a spring-damper model and the
[velocity Verlet integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration)
method.

Standard Ready Player Me 3D avatars don't yet include features like hair bones.
Until they do, you'll need to add the dynamic bones and weights to the model
yourself. Here's an example of rigged hair in Blender.

<img src="images/ponytail.jpg"/>


Once your custom rig is in place, you can configure the dynamic bones
by setting the `modelDynamicBones` property to the `avatar` object of
the `showAvatar` method. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Load and show the avatar
try {
  await head.showAvatar( {
    url: './avatars/custom.glb',
    body: 'F',
    avatarMood: 'neutral',
    ttsLang: "en-GB",
    ttsVoice: "en-GB-Standard-A",
    lipsyncLang: 'en',
    modelDynamicBones: [
      {
        bone: "ponytail1", type: "full", stiffness: 20, damping: 2,
        limits: [null,null,[null,0.01],null],
      },
      {
        bone: "ponytail2", type: "full", stiffness: 200, damping: 10,
        pivot: true
      },
      {
        bone: "ponytail3", type: "full", stiffness: 400, damping: 10,
        excludes: [{"bone":"Head","deltaLocal":[0,0.05,0.02],"radius":0.13}]
      }
    ]
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

Each item in `modelDynamicBones` array represents a dynamic bone, which
can be configured using the following properties:

Property | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
`bone` | The name of the bone in your custom skeleton. Note that each dynamic bone must have a parent bone. | `bone: "ponytail1"`
`type` | <ul><li>`"point"` updates only the bone's local position [x,y,z]. It is fast to calculate, but may cause skinned meshes to deform unnaturally.</li><li>`"link"` updates only the parent's quaternions (XZ rotations).</li><li>`"mix1"` mixes XZ rotations with a stretch (bone length, position change).</li><li>`"mix2"` mixes XZ rotations with a twist (Y rotations).</li><li>`"full"` link with both stretch and twist.</li></ul> | `type: "full"`
`stiffness` | Mass-normalized spring constant `k` [m/s^2]. Either a non-negative number or an array with separate values for each dimension [x, y, z, t]. | `stiffness: 20`
`damping` | Mass-normalized damping coefficient `c` [1/s]. Either a non-negative number or an array with separate values for each dimension [x, y, z, t]. | `damping: 2`
`external` | External scaling factor between [0,1] that can be used to scale down the external forces caused by parent's movement. If set to `0`, the bone is rigid and moves with its parent without experiencing any external force. If set to `1`, the bone follows its parent with a lag (inertia) and feels the force.  OPTIONAL, default value `1.0` | `external: 0.7`
`limits` | Sets the limiting range [low, high] for each dimension [x, y, z, t] in meters [m]. This can help prevent situations in which meshes overlap due to sudden movements or when the amplitude becomes unrealistic. Limits are applied in local space. OPTIONAL, default `null` (no limit) | `limits: [null,null,[null,0.01],null]`
`deltaLocal` | Local position translation [dx,dy,dz] in meters [m]. OPTIONAL, default `null` | `deltaLocal: [0,0.01,0]`
`deltaWorld` | World position translation [dx,dy,dz] in meters [m]. OPTIONAL, default `null` | `deltaWorld: [0,-0.02,0]`
`pivot` | If `true`, the bone becomes a free-hanging bone along the Y-axis. This means that the parent's X/Z rotations are automatically compensated. Use with caution, as this requires additional computational effort, and the `limits` do not apply as usual. OPTIONAL, default `false` | `pivot: true`
`excludes` | Sets one or more spherical excluded zones that act as invisible force fields, limiting the movement of the bone. An array of objects in the format `{ bone, deltaLocal, radius}` in which `bone` specifies the center bone name, `deltaLocal` (optional) offset [x,y,z] relative to center bone, and `radius` in meters. OPTIONAL, default `null` |¬†`excludes: [ { bone: "Head", deltaLocal: [0,0.05,0.02], radius: 0.13 } ]`
`helper` | If `true`, add a helper object to the scene to assist with visualizing the bone during testing. If the dynamic bone type is "point", displays only a square, otherwise also the line from parent to the bone. OPTIONAL, default `false` | `helper: true`


Finding a good combination of `stiffness`, `damping`, and `external`, is mostly
a matter of trial and error. Turn on the helper property or use the test app
to fine-tune the settings while running animations typical to your use case.

> [!TIP]
> For dynamic bones of type `"point"`, you can simulate gravity by applying

### Appendix F: Using Blendshapes with Audio (Advanced)

You can optionally provide an animation template object to drive custom blendshapes or morph targets in sync with audio playback. This is especially useful when you have a series of facial animation frames from external sources, such as Azure TTS 3D blenshapes or motion capture data, and want them to play alongside the spoken audio. Below is the general format of the animation template object:

```js
{
  name: "blendshapes",
  dt: [ 33, 33, 33, ... ],  // durations in milliseconds for each frame
  vs: {
    "mouthRollLower": [ 0, 0.05, 0.1, ... ],
    "jawOpen": [ 0, 0.2, 0.4, ... ],
    // ... additional blendshape keys
  }
}

```
 - `name`: A simple string identifier, for example "blendshapes".
 - `dt`: An array of per-frame durations (in ms). Each entry determines how long to stay on (or blend to) that frame before moving to the next one.
 - `vs`: An object in which each key is the name of a blendshape, and each value is an array of values for each corresponding frame in dt.

During audio playback, these frames will automatically be scheduled to match the timeline of your audio. This ensures your custom facial expressions (e.g., jawOpen, mouthRollLower, etc.) animate in perfect sync with the spoken content.

For a practical example of how to use this feature with Azure Text-to-Speech facial blendshapes, refer to examples/azure-blendshapes.html in the repository. This example demonstrates how to integrate blendshape animations derived from Azure‚Äôs output into your application.

**Note**: Be aware of a potential quality issue when using Azure blendshapes for lip-sync. The lip-sync may appear somewhat unnatural‚Äîfor instance, the mouth might open too widely, and the lips may fail to touch on phonemes/visemes where they should. This might be because unlike Oculus visemes, which are specifically designed for accurate lip-syncing, Azure's output relies on ARKit blendshapes‚Äîa more generic standard for facial expressions rather than precise lip movements. Furthermore, Azure‚Äôs blendshapes are likely optimized for their own avatar system and not specifically for RPM avatars.

### Appendix G: Streaming Audio and Lip-sync (Advanced)

This low-level streaming interface is designed for real-time scenarios, such as speech-to-speech or live TTS integrations where latency must be minimized. Use this interface if you require direct, chunked audio playback and on-the-fly lip-sync updates. You can, for instance, integrate a real-time TTS pipeline (like Azure Speech SDK or another live audio source) that continuously streams audio and word/viseme data into TalkingHead.

**Important:** The calling application must handle all aspects of managing and synchronizing the data streams (e.g., facial expressions, eye contact, hand gestures), as well as preventing concurrency issues, buffering multiple sources, or overlapping audio chunks. The system is designed to handle one stream at a time. Ensure streamStop is called before starting a new stream with streamStart.

#### API Overview

##### 1. `streamStart(opt={}, onAudioStart, onAudioEnd, onSubtitles)`

Enters streaming mode using an `AudioWorklet` for low-latency playback. Parameters:

- `opt` *(object, optional)* ‚Äì Settings controlling streaming behavior:  
  - `sampleRate` ‚Äì A number in the range \[8000, 96000\].  
  - `gain` ‚Äì Sets the playback gain (volume) for the streaming audio.  
  - `lipsyncLang` ‚Äì Specifies lip-sync language if you want viseme generation using words. Defaults to avatar `lipsyncLang`, or to options `lipsyncLang` value. 
  - `lipsyncType` ‚Äì Specifies lip-sync data type. Can take one of the values `visemes` (default), `blendshapes`, and `words`.
  - `mood` ‚Äì Sets avatar mood upon starting the stream.  
- `onAudioStart` *(function, optional)* ‚Äì Callback invoked the moment audio playback starts.  
- `onAudioEnd` *(function, optional)* ‚Äì Callback invoked automatically once audio playback concludes.  
- `onSubtitles` *(function, optional)* ‚Äì Callback to handle showing subtitle text.

Upon calling `streamStart`, all queued speech (`speakText`, `speakAudio`) is stopped, the engine enters streaming mode, and the avatar prepares for real-time lip-sync. You can then feed audio via `streamAudio()`.

##### 2. `streamAudio(r)`

Sends one chunk of PCM audio data (16-bit little-endian) plus lip-sync data. Parameters:

- `r.audio` ‚Äì An `ArrayBuffer` or typed array of **16-bit LE PCM** samples. These are played immediately.  
- `r.visemes`, `r.vtimes`, `r.vdurations` *(optional)* ‚Äì Directly schedule lip-sync visemes at specific times with specific durations. This is the default type of lip-sync data.
- `r.words`, `r.wtimes`, `r.wdurations` *(optional)* ‚Äì Per-word timings and durations (e.g. TTS), allowing the library to create subtitles and/or calculate visemes if the `lipsyncType` option is set to `words`.
- `r.anims` *(optional)* ‚Äì An array of blendshape animations that play in sync with the audio. Requires setting `lipsyncType` option to `blendshapes`.   

Each call to `streamAudio()` schedules an immediate chunk for playback and any included lip-sync or subtitle data on the animation timeline. Include only lip-sync data as specified in the `lipsyncType` option via the `streamStart` call. You can include any number of visemes, anims, or words which are not necessarily associated with the included audio chunk. You need to buffer the lip-sync data in the application and send it alongside the audio chunks.

##### 3. `streamNotifyEnd()`

Signals that no more chunks are expected for the current streaming session. Playback stops automatically once queued audio finishes. This is useful for gracefully concluding real-time TTS streams when your pipeline has no additional data to send.

##### 4. `streamStop()`

Forces an immediate end to streaming mode, disconnecting the internal `AudioWorklet`. All queued lip-sync animations (visemes, blendshapes) are cleared, and the avatar reverts to its idle state. If needed, you can later re-start streaming via `streamStart()` again.

#### Example Usage

Refer to the example provided in the repository `azure-audio-streaming.html` on how to integrate this interface with Azure TTS streamed audio.
